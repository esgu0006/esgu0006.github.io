I created my web portfolio with bootstrap. I tried to keep it simple and not over complicate the layout.
I had some issues trying to add in a carousel component. In the end I decided not to include it. 
I also had some issues trying to include a grid and ended up using flex instead.
I didn't end up using other assets or libraries as I wanted to see how closly I could match my mockup with the default assets.
With the expception of the social media icons I used all of my own photographs and designs.
